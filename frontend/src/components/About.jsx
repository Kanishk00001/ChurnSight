              Building Churn Prediction Model
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-6 text-gray-600">
              Growing a business involves a strategy of both acquiring new
              customers and preventing existing ones from churning. So, just as
              much as we invest in acquiring the right leads and converting
              them, we need to invest the same, or sometimes even more, in
              retaining our existing customers.

              At ChurnSite, we are passionate about helping businesses retain
              their most valuable assetâ€”their customers. In todayâ€™s fast-paced
              digital world, customer churn is a major challenge for businesses
              across industries. Losing customers not only affects revenue but
              also increases the cost of acquiring new ones. Thatâ€™s where we
              come in. Our platform is built with cutting-edge machine learning
              and predictive analytics to help businesses identify at-risk
              customers before they leave. By analyzing customer behavior,
              engagement patterns, and key business metrics, we provide
              actionable insights that enable companies to take proactive
              measures to improve customer retention.
